#A stochastic SIR epidemic model on a complex network with self-protective behaviour

The state of each individual in this system in given by one of the following classes:
*  Susceptible (S)
*  Infected (I)
*  Recovered (R)

## Parameters

Paramater | Description                | Reference value

$T_i$     | Infectious period          | 14
$q_i$     | Probability of infection   | 0-0.02
$p$       | Shortcut density           | 0-16
$t_0$     | Isolation start time       | 30
$N$       | Population size            | 4E6
$N_R$     | Number of cases triggering<br>self-protective behaviour | 10E3-10E4
